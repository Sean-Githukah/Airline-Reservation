# Guide on how to test the database locally

1. Navigate to the folder/ directory were you want the code project to be in

2. Clone this repository using

```git clone git@github.com:Sean-Githukah/Airline-Reservation.git```

3. cd or navigate into the folder that will be creates when you clone this repository

```cd Airline-Reservation```

4. Open the project using a text editor of your choice. I recommend using visual studio code for this. Incase you do not have visual studio code visit [this website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download and install visual studio code.


If you have visual studio code, you can open it by running ```code .``` and hitting enter.


Optionally open visual studio code and select "file" then "open" then navigate to where the project code was stored. This will also work well.


# We now need to create the database locally for this we need to first access our PostgreSQL database. Follow the following steps:

1. In your command prompt or terminal type the following then hit enter ```psql -U postgres```

2. You will then be ablt to type in the commands that are in the schema.sql file and hit enter.


# Instead of going through all this, you can use the PGAdmin4 graphical user interface application. It will help you avoid using the terminal/ command prompt.
